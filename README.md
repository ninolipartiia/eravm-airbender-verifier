# EraVM Airbender Verifier

This repository combines reduced EraVM verifier libraries with an Airbender guest and host proving app.
It is used to reproduce ZKsync Era mainnet batch verification, compare VM execution, generate Airbender
FRI proofs, and wrap those proofs into SNARK proofs.

The long-running prover service that drives this pipeline in production lives in `zksync-era`, not here.
This repository is self-contained around the guest, the `eravm-prover-host` CLI/library, and the verifier
libraries; the service consumes `eravm-prover-host` as a dependency.

## Layout

- `crates/`: reduced verifier libraries extracted from `zksync-era` (entrypoint crate: `zksync_airbender_verifier`).
- `guest/`: Airbender guest program that reads `AirbenderVerifierInput` and runs `verify()`.
- `host/`: host runner/prover app for batch execution and proof generation.
- `testdata/era_mainnet_batches/`: compressed mainnet batch corpus tracked via Git LFS.
- `scripts/cycle_model/`, `scripts/precompile_calibration/`: offline cycle-cost calibration.

## Benchmarking

The guest fails hard if a batch exceeds its heap or the per-proof cycle limit, so
both are measurable in-tree: peak heap (native proxy, true in-guest peak by heap
bisection, and per-phase attribution) and guest cycles (measured per phase, or
predicted from a vm2 trace with no RISC-V execution).

See **[docs/benchmarking.md](docs/benchmarking.md)** for the workflow, including the
prerequisites that are easy to miss (a riscv-capable clang on macOS) and the
benchmarking-only feature flags that must never ship in a proved guest.

## Quick Start

Build guest artifacts:

```sh
cargo airbender build --project guest
```

Install Git LFS if `git lfs` is not available yet:

Ubuntu:

```sh
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

macOS:

```sh
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

Fetch one compressed mainnet batch from Git LFS:

```sh
./scripts/fetch_lfs_batches.sh 84730.bin.gz
```

Compare legacy and fast VM execution on that batch:

```sh
cargo run --release -p zksync_vm_compare --bin vm_compare -- --batch-files 84730.bin.gz
```

Run host execution:

```sh
cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host -- --action run --batch-files 84730.bin.gz
```

Run host proving:

```sh
cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host -- --action prove --batch-files <number>.bin.gz
```

Process all available batches:

```sh
cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host -- --action prove --all-batches
```

## Mainnet Batch Corpus

The repository stores reproducible batch inputs in `testdata/era_mainnet_batches/binary/*.bin.gz`.
Those files are tracked via Git LFS and excluded by default via [`.lfsconfig`](.lfsconfig), so a normal clone keeps only small pointer files until you explicitly fetch the batches you want.

If `git lfs` is missing, install it first:

Ubuntu:

```sh
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

macOS:

```sh
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

Fetch the same curated batches that CI uses:

```sh
./scripts/fetch_lfs_batches.sh 84730.bin.gz,84731.bin.gz,84732.bin.gz
```

Fetch every tracked batch:

```sh
./scripts/fetch_lfs_batches.sh --all
```

The default `--batches-dir` assumes you run these `cargo run -p ...` commands from the workspace root. If you invoke the binaries from another directory, pass `--batches-dir` explicitly.

Import the existing local corpus into the repo as compressed Git LFS objects:

```sh
./scripts/import_mainnet_batches.sh \
  --source-dir /home/popzxc/workspace/airbender/storage/era_mainnet_batches/binary \
  --all
```

More detailed batch-data instructions live in [testdata/era_mainnet_batches/README.md](testdata/era_mainnet_batches/README.md).

## Full e2e proving flow

If you're going to use GPU proving for SNARK, you also need to set up bellman CUDA.

Important: right now, bellman-cuda supports ONLY CUDA 12, while airbender can work with both 12 and 13.
So if you have CUDA 13 installed, your options are either to rely on CPU proving if acceptable, or install CUDA 12 instead.

```bash
# `era-bellman-cuda` & SNARK wrapper use old code that doesn't always respect `CUDA_HOME` and instead
# on linux checks `/usr/local/cuda`
echo $CUDA_HOME
# If your output is not `/usr/local/cuda`, you might want to create a symlink, e.g. `sudo ln -s /opt/cuda /usr/local/cuda`.

if [ ! -d "era-bellman-cuda" ]; then
    git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/era-bellman-cuda.git
else
    echo "era-bellman-cuda repository already exists. Skipping clone."
fi
# Now cmake will find the CUDA compiler (nvcc) via the updated PATH
cmake -Bera-bellman-cuda/build -Sera-bellman-cuda/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build era-bellman-cuda/build/ -j16

BELLMAN_CUDA_DIR="$(pwd)/era-bellman-cuda"

# === IMPORTANT ===
# Add BELLMAN_CUDA_DIR to your *rc file (e.g. `.bashrc` / `.zshrc`)!
```
Then you can use the following flow:

```bash
# Clone the repo and set up the branch (check out the required branch)
git clone https://github.com/matter-labs/eravm-airbender-verifier.git
cd eravm-airbender-verifier
git checkout <desired_branch> # e.g. popzxc-snark-integrated-properly at the time of writing

# Download artifacts for proving
git lfs install

# Set up CRS key and stack for SNARK proving. The trusted setup must already
# exist on disk before the prover starts — point at it via `--trusted-setup`
# or `SNARK_TRUSTED_SETUP_FILE` (mirrors era's `KZG_TRUSTED_SETUP_FILE`).
# IMPORTANT: CPU/GPU use different keys. The `download-trusted-setup`
# subcommand picks the right URL based on the build's `gpu_snark` feature.
cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host -- download-trusted-setup --output setup.key &
cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host --features gpu_snark -- download-trusted-setup --output setup_gpu.key

ulimit -s unlimited

# Generate FRI proof
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host --features gpu_snark -- prove-fri --batch-files 84730.bin.gz --output-dir ./artifacts/proofs

# Generate SNARK proof
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host --features gpu_snark -- prove-snark --proof-files ./artifacts/proofs/batch-84730/fri_proof.json  --output-dir ./artifacts/proofs --trusted-setup setup_gpu.key
```

If you need to save intermediate SNARK artifacts:

```bash
# On CPU
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host -- prove-snark --proof-files ./artifacts/proofs/batch-84730/fri_proof.json  --output-dir ./artifacts/proofs --trusted-setup setup.key --save-intermediates

# On GPU
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host --features gpu_snark -- prove-snark --proof-files ./artifacts/proofs/batch-84730/fri_proof.json  --output-dir ./artifacts/proofs --trusted-setup setup_gpu.key --save-intermediates
```

Note: `--features gpu_snark` is not technically required, it enables GPU SNARK proving, without it FRI proving will still be done on GPU, but SNARK wrapping will be done on CPU. If you use CPU, don't forget to use the correct CRS key.

### Verification keys

The canonical FRI and SNARK verification keys are published as GitHub **release assets** (`fri_vk.bin`, `snark_vk.json`), alongside the guest binary (`app.bin`, `app.text`) and a `checksums.txt`. They are built from the released commit by [`.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yaml`](.github/workflows/release-artifacts.yaml) — not committed to the repo — so they always match the source they were derived from. The server loads them from disk rather than deriving them on the fly; download them from a release or point the server at a local copy via `--fri-vk` (`FRI_VK`). See [`vks/README.md`](vks/README.md).

VK generation is costly (GPU + trusted setup). CI regenerates the keys from the PR's freshly-built guest to run the proving test (the `host-integration-run` job, only when guest/VK-relevant code changes), and the release build regenerates them to publish the assets — but you don't normally need keys locally. Regenerate them locally only when proving against a locally-changed guest:

```bash
cargo run --release -p eravm-prover-host --features gpu_snark -- gen-vks \
    --output-dir vks \
    --trusted-setup setup_gpu.key
```

### CUDA-free builds

The FRI prover always runs on GPU (Airbender's CUDA `gpu_prover`), so the default build links CUDA. The default-on `gpu_fri` cargo feature gates that dependency, so a `--no-default-features` build of `eravm-prover-host` is completely CUDA-free — it can verify FRI proofs and wrap them into SNARKs on CPU, but cannot generate FRI proofs:

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features -p eravm-prover-host
```

### Integration tests

`host/tests/integration_test.rs` drives the proving pipeline in-process (no server). The tests are `#[ignore]` because they need the LFS batch corpus — and, for proving, a GPU, the guest binary, and the SNARK trusted setup. CI runs the end-to-end proving test in the `host-integration-run` job whenever guest/VK-relevant code changes, deriving the VKs from the PR's freshly-built guest. Run it locally with:

```bash
# CPU-only: native verification vs. transpiler execution
cargo test -p eravm-prover-host --test integration_test \
    -- --ignored --nocapture host_runs_batch_native_and_transpiler

# GPU: FRI proving followed by SNARK wrapping, end to end
cargo test -p eravm-prover-host --features gpu_snark --test integration_test \
    -- --ignored --nocapture host_proves_fri_then_snark
```
