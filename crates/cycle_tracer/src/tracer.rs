/// emits RAW counts (the per-feature cycle weights are learned by the offline
/// fit, never baked in here). Every hook only observes — it returns
/// [`ShouldStop::Continue`] and mutates no VM state — so a batch executed with
/// this tracer runs identically to the proved guest.

/// Cloning shares one recorder: clone the tracer per transaction (matching how
/// the fast VM's tuple `TracerDispatcher` is fed) and all counts accumulate into
