//! Cycle-count estimation inputs and result.
//!
//! Defines the two batch-level pieces the VM trace cannot observe — the
//! [`BatchContext`] inputs the sequencer supplies, and the [`CycleEstimate`]
//! result the model produces. A tracer (the sibling
//! `zksync-era-airbender-cycles-tracer` crate for the fast VM, or zksync-era's
//! in-tree legacy-VM tracer) assembles a [`crate::FeatureVector`] and feeds it,
//! together with these scalars, to [`crate::CostModel`].
//!
//! The API takes scalars rather than a `FinishedL1Batch` on purpose: it keeps
//! this crate free of the VM-interface types (which are versioned per protocol),
//! so a sequencer on any compatible version can call it by passing
//! `pubdata_input.len()` and `state_diffs.len()` directly.
//!
//! Feature provenance:
//! - `vm_execution` opcode/crypto features — from the tracer (exact).
//! - `pubdata_bytes`, `state_diff_count` — from the finished batch (exact).
//! - the rest ([`BatchContext`]) — the sequencer derives these from its storage
//!   view and the bytecodes it is about to prove. At sequencing time the merkle
//!   witness does not exist yet, so `merkle_leaf_count` is the count of distinct
//!   storage slots the batch touched (what the tree will witness) — an estimate
//!   of the calibrated witness quantity, not a byte-identical copy.
