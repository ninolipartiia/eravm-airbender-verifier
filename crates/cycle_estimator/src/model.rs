//! The fitted cost model and cycle-count prediction.
//!
//! The model is a set of non-negative linear predictors (one per verify() phase,
//! plus an aggregate `total`) of the form `cycles = base + Σ coeff_i · feature_i`,
//! learned offline by `scripts/cycle_model/fit_cost_model.py`. The canonical
//! fitted table is committed at `model/cost_table.json` and compiled into the
//! binary via `include_str!`, so a deployed sequencer needs no model file on disk.
//!
//! To ship a new model: refit, drop the resulting `cost_table.json` into
//! `crates/cycle_estimator/model/`, and rebuild (see `scripts/cycle_model/README.md`).
