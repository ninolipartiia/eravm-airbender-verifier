//! CI guard: the embedded cost model must keep predicting a frozen set of real,
//! measured batches within tolerance. Runs in normal CI — the ground-truth
//! effective cycles are baked into the committed fixture, so no batch corpus or
//! guest execution is needed.
//!
//! This is a regression tripwire, not a re-validation: it catches an accidental
//! (or accuracy-worsening) change to `model/cost_table.json` or to the prediction
//! code. Genuine model improvements still pass (thresholds, not exact pins).
//!
//! The fixture is a frozen snapshot of the 513xxx hold-out set (features +
//! measured effective/native cycles = raw + weighted delegations). Refresh it
//! only when the guest/verifier changes enough to move real cycle counts (see
//! `scripts/cycle_model/README.md`).
