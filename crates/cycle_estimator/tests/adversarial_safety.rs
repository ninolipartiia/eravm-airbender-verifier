//! Adversarial safety regression: no attacker-controlled batch is ever both judged
//! trustworthy by the gate AND materially under-predicted.
//!
//! Each fixture batch was produced on a local era node (see
//! scripts/precompile_calibration — CycleHammer / SlotReader), maximizing one
//! opcode/feature the fitted model under-prices, and its TRUE guest cycles were
//! measured with cycle_bench. Left unhardened, the worst under-predicted ~9×
//! (transient storage, priced 0) and ~3× (pure arithmetic). The gate must, for
//! every batch, EITHER cover it within the seal margin OR refuse to price it
//! (unpriced precompile / out-of-calibration), so it can never silently ship an
//! over-budget batch. This locks in the OPCODE_FLOORS + calibration-envelope guard.
